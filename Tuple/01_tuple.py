#tuple can be created by using ()
t=(5,8,65,87,3,34)

print(t)
'''Tuple doesn't support object assignment i.e we can't change tuple value once privided
i.e''' 
t[0]=35 #This is an error

#This is the main difference b/w list and tuple that in list we can change it's value and in tuple we can't change the value once privided
